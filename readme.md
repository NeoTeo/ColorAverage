An color cast remover I wrote to automate the task.

Drag an image with a color cast onto the the application window to get
the average color of the image and to have its inverse applied to it as an overlay filter.

Currently hardcoded to save out to my own tmp directory.

Todo:
* Add ability to save in supported file formats to a user selected location.
* Show inverse color and hex values.
* Add slider to control amount of overlay.
